# Implementation Plan Analysis: Overlap & Conflict Resolution
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Analyst:** Documentation Specialist
**Status:** COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Two implementation plans were analyzed for overlap, conflicts, and synchronization opportunities:

1. **mcp-common Plan** (10 weeks): ACB-native library development for 9 MCP servers
2. **session-mgmt-mcp Plan** (16 weeks): Standalone server improvements with ACB integration

**Key Findings:**
- **29.4% overall completion** (ahead of schedule by 3 weeks)
- **6 major overlaps identified** (4 critical conflicts requiring immediate resolution)
- **Unified roadmap reduces timeline** from 26 weeks sequential → 13 weeks parallel
- **Resource optimization:** 50% reduction in duplicate work through coordination

---

## Detailed Overlap Analysis

### Overlap 1: ACB Integration Foundation ⚠️ CRITICAL

**mcp-common Approach:**
```python
# Phase 1: Create ACB-native foundation library
from acb import register_pkg
register_pkg("mcp_common")

class HTTPClientAdapter:
    """ACB adapter with MODULE_ID and lifecycle"""
    MODULE_ID = "mcp_common.adapters.http"
```

**session-mgmt Approach:**
```python
# Phase 1: Install ACB directly, use raw ACB APIs
from acb.config import Settings
from acb.depends import depends

config = Settings.from_file("session_mgmt.toml")
```

**Conflict Analysis:**
| Aspect | mcp-common | session-mgmt | Conflict Level |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ACB Usage | Via library abstraction | Direct ACB APIs | HIGH |
| Configuration | MCPBaseSettings class | Raw ACB Settings | HIGH |
| Adapters | Shared adapters module | Per-server implementation | CRITICAL |
| DI Patterns | Centralized DI config | Direct depends usage | HIGH |

**Impact of Conflict:**
- **Without coordination:** session-mgmt implements direct ACB (2 weeks) → migrates to mcp-common (2 weeks) = 4 weeks total
- **With coordination:** Wait for mcp-common (2 weeks) → adopt mcp-common (2 weeks) = 4 weeks total but better outcome
- **Current situation:** Phase 2.7 already wiring direct ACB → requires migration later

**Recommended Resolution:**

```
Decision: Accept Phase 2.7 completion with direct ACB, migrate in Phase 5

Rationale:
├─ Phase 2.7 is 80% complete (core wiring done)
├─ Blocking now delays overall progress 4-6 weeks
├─ Migration cost is ~40 hours (acceptable)
├─ Learning from session-mgmt improves mcp-common design
└─ Risk is LOW (DI patterns are similar, migration straightforward)

Timeline:
Week 7: Complete Phase 2.7 with direct acb.depends
Week 8-9: Build mcp-common with lessons from Phase 2.7
Week 10-11: Migrate session-mgmt to mcp-common patterns
Result: 40 hours of rework vs. 4-6 weeks of delay
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Document current session-mgmt DI patterns thoroughly
- Use session-mgmt patterns as input for mcp-common design
- Create migration checklist during Phase 2.7 completion
- Budget 40 hours for Phase 5 DI migration

---

### Overlap 2: Configuration Management 🔴 CRITICAL

**mcp-common Plan:**
```python
# config/base.py - MCPBaseSettings class
from acb.config import Settings
from pydantic import Field

class MCPBaseSettings(Settings):
    """Base settings with ACB + YAML support.

    Loads from:
    1. settings/local.yaml (gitignored)
    2. settings/{server_name}.yaml
    3. Environment variables {SERVER_NAME}_*
    4. Defaults
    """
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_file=".env",
        case_sensitive=False,
        validate_default=True,
    )

# Usage in servers:
class MailgunSettings(MCPBaseSettings):
    api_key: str = Field(description="Mailgun API key")
    domain: str = Field(description="Mailgun domain")
```

**session-mgmt Plan:**
```python
# Phase 1 Week 1-2: Replace custom config.py (658 lines)
from acb import Config

# Direct ACB usage, then migrate again to mcp-common
config = Config.from_file("session_mgmt.toml")
```

**Conflict Analysis:**

| Phase | mcp-common | session-mgmt | Redundancy |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Current | Design only | 658 lines custom config.py | 0% |
| After Phase 1 | MCPBaseSettings ready | Direct ACB config | 100% redundant |
| After Phase 5 | MCPBaseSettings used | Adopts MCPBaseSettings | 0% (aligned) |

**Duplication Cost:**
```
Without coordination:
Week 1-2: session-mgmt implements direct ACB config (16 hours)
Week 8-9: mcp-common implements MCPBaseSettings (12 hours)
Week 10-11: session-mgmt migrates to MCPBaseSettings (12 hours)
Total: 40 hours, 2 migrations

With coordination:
Week 8-9: mcp-common implements MCPBaseSettings (12 hours)
Week 10-11: session-mgmt adopts MCPBaseSettings (12 hours)
Total: 24 hours, 1 migration
Savings: 16 hours, simpler codebase
```

**Recommended Resolution:**

```
Decision: Defer session-mgmt config migration to Phase 5

Current Approach:
├─ Keep existing config.py (658 lines) through Week 9
├─ Build MCPBaseSettings in mcp-common Phase 4 (Week 8-9)
├─ session-mgmt adopts MCPBaseSettings in Phase 5 (Week 10-11)
└─ Single migration path, no double work

Benefits:
1. No throwaway ACB config implementation
2. MCPBaseSettings battle-tested before adoption
3. session-mgmt config requirements inform mcp-common design
4. 16-hour time savings
5. Simpler migration path
```

**Migration Strategy:**
```python
# Phase 5 (Week 10-11): One-step migration
# Before:
from session_mgmt_mcp.config import (
    SessionConfig,
    ReflectionConfig,
    CrackerjackConfig,
    # ... 33 config classes
)

# After:
from mcp_common.config import MCPBaseSettings
from pydantic import Field

class SessionMgmtSettings(MCPBaseSettings):
    """Unified settings replacing 33 classes."""
    # Session settings
    max_reflections: int = Field(default=1000)
    embedding_model: str = Field(default="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

    # Reflection settings
    min_similarity: float = Field(default=0.7)

    # Crackerjack settings
    enable_integration: bool = Field(default=True)

    # ... consolidated from 33 classes to 1

# Result: 658 lines → 100 lines = -558 lines (-85%)
```

---

### Overlap 3: HTTP Client & Rate Limiting 🟡 MEDIUM

**mcp-common Plan:**
```python
# Phase 1-2: Build reusable adapters
from acb.depends import depends

class HTTPClientAdapter:
    """Reusable HTTP client with connection pooling."""
    MODULE_ID = "mcp_common.adapters.http"

    async def _create_client(self) -> httpx.AsyncClient:
        # Singleton with connection pooling
        return self._client

class RateLimiterAdapter:
    """Token bucket rate limiter."""
    def __init__(self, max_requests: int, window: int):
        self.max_requests = max_requests
        self.window = window
```

**session-mgmt Plan:**
```python
# Phase 1: Direct ACB usage (implied, not explicitly mentioned)
# Would need to implement or wait for mcp-common

# Currently: No rate limiting, basic HTTP
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.post(...)
```

**Conflict Analysis:**

| Feature | mcp-common Timeline | session-mgmt Need | Gap |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|-----|
| HTTPClientAdapter | Week 8 (Phase 4) | Week 1 (Phase 1) | 7 weeks |
| RateLimiterAdapter | Week 8 (Phase 4) | Week 1 (Phase 1) | 7 weeks |
| Security Adapters | Week 9 (Phase 4) | Week 2 (Phase 1) | 7 weeks |

**Current Status:**
- session-mgmt has **working HTTP** (not optimal, but functional)
- session-mgmt has **no rate limiting** (acceptable for now)
- mcp-common Phase 3 **already added rate limiting** to all servers
- No immediate crisis, can wait for mcp-common

**Recommended Resolution:**

```
Decision: session-mgmt continues with existing HTTP until Phase 5

Rationale:
├─ Current HTTP works (not broken, just not optimal)
├─ Rate limiting already added in mcp-common Phase 3 ✅
├─ Building custom HTTP adapter = throwaway work
├─ 7-week wait is acceptable (no production issues)
└─ Phase 5 adoption gets all adapters at once

Timeline:
Week 7: session-mgmt continues with existing HTTP
Week 8-9: mcp-common builds HTTPClientAdapter + RateLimiterAdapter
Week 10-11: session-mgmt adopts all adapters in single migration
Result: No throwaway work, cleaner migration
```

**Exception Handling:**
```
IF session-mgmt HTTP becomes a blocker (performance issue):
THEN:
  1. Extract minimal HTTPClientAdapter from raindropio-mcp
  2. Use as interim solution (3 days effort)
  3. Replace with mcp-common adapter in Phase 5
  Cost: 3 days interim + 1 day migration = 4 days
ELSE:
  Continue as planned (no interim work)
```

---

### Overlap 4: Dependency Injection 🔴 CRITICAL (ACTIVE CONFLICT)

**mcp-common Plan:**
```python
# di/configure.py - Centralized DI configuration
from acb.depends import depends

def configure_di():
    """Configure DI container for MCP servers."""
    # Register adapters
    depends.register(HTTPClientAdapter, scope="singleton")
    depends.register(RateLimiterAdapter, scope="singleton")
    depends.register(SanitizerAdapter, scope="singleton")

    # Register config
    depends.register_provider("config", lambda: MCPBaseSettings())

    # Register logger
    depends.register_provider("logger", lambda: get_logger())
```

**session-mgmt Plan (Phase 2.7 - IN PROGRESS):**
```python
# session_mgmt_mcp/di/ - Direct ACB wiring
from acb.depends import depends

# Providers being wired directly:
depends.provider("logger")(get_logger)
depends.provider("permissions")(get_permissions_manager)
depends.provider("lifecycle")(get_lifecycle_handlers)

# Usage in tools:
@depends.inject
def tool_function(logger: LoggerProtocol = depends.inject()):
    logger.info("Direct ACB dependency injection")
```

**Conflict Timeline:**

```
Week 7 (NOW):
├─ Phase 2.7 is 80% complete
├─ Core DI wiring operational
├─ Tool modules injection-ready
├─ Tests passing (with some failures to fix)
└─ Patterns documented

Week 8-9 (mcp-common Phase 4):
├─ Would build different DI patterns
├─ MCPBaseSettings with different provider setup
├─ Adapter registration conventions
└─ May differ from session-mgmt patterns

Week 10-11 (Phase 5):
├─ session-mgmt migrates to mcp-common patterns
├─ ~40 hours of rework estimated
├─ Update all tool modules
└─ Test comprehensive DI changes
```

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

| Approach | Timeline | Effort | Risk | Quality |
|----------|----------|--------|------|---------|
| **Option A: Continue Phase 2.7** | Week 7 complete | 40h rework later | LOW | Learning informs mcp-common |
| **Option B: Block Phase 2.7** | Wait until Week 10 | 0h rework | HIGH | 4-6 week delay |
| **Option C: Hybrid approach** | Week 7-9 planning | 20h coordination | MEDIUM | Partial alignment |

**Recommended Resolution (Option A):**

```
Decision: Complete Phase 2.7, accept 40-hour migration in Phase 5

Justification:
├─ Phase 2.7 is 80% complete (blocking now wastes 32 hours)
├─ session-mgmt patterns inform better mcp-common design
├─ 4-6 week delay is unacceptable for overall progress
├─ 40 hours of rework is acceptable cost
├─ Risk is LOW (DI patterns are similar, migration is mechanical)
└─ Quality improves (mcp-common learns from session-mgmt mistakes)

Implementation:
1. Week 7: Complete Phase 2.7 with full documentation
   ├─ Document all DI patterns used
   ├─ Document provider naming conventions
   ├─ Document injection patterns in tools
   └─ Create checklist of items to migrate

2. Week 8-9: Build mcp-common DI using session-mgmt learnings
   ├─ Review session-mgmt patterns
   ├─ Extract best practices
   ├─ Design improved patterns where possible
   └─ Document migration path from session-mgmt style

3. Week 10-11: Execute migration with clear checklist
   ├─ Replace direct depends.provider with mcp_common.di
   ├─ Update all tool modules systematically
   ├─ Test each module after migration
   └─ Validate no regressions

Migration Budget:
├─ Documentation: 4 hours
├─ DI module updates: 16 hours
├─ Tool module updates: 12 hours
├─ Testing & validation: 8 hours
└─ Total: 40 hours (acceptable)
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Keep Phase 2.7 patterns as reference during migration
- Create migration script for mechanical changes
- Validate each module independently before integration
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout

### Overlap 5: Test Coverage Improvement 🟢 LOW

**mcp-common Plan:**
```
Phase 4 (Week 3-5): Test Coverage Improvement
├─ Target: All servers to 70% minimum coverage
├─ Priority: unifi-mcp (26% → 70%), mailgun-mcp, opera-cloud-mcp
├─ Strategy: Use mcp-common testing utilities
└─ Timeline: 3 weeks (Week 3-5 of mcp-common plan)
```

**session-mgmt Plan:**
```
Phase 4 (Week 13-16): Test Coverage Sprint
├─ Target: session-mgmt-mcp to 85%+ coverage
├─ Week 13-14: Systematic test creation
├─ Week 15-16: Integration and E2E tests
└─ Timeline: 4 weeks (Week 13-16 of session-mgmt plan)
```

**Conflict Analysis:**

| Aspect | mcp-common | session-mgmt | Alignment |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Target Coverage | 70% (ecosystem) | 85%+ (single server) | Different scales |
| Timeline | Week 3-5 | Week 13-16 | 10-week gap |
| Strategy | Multi-server | Single server focus | Different approaches |
| Dependencies | mcp-common testing utils | Same testing utils | Aligned |

**No Critical Conflict:** Different targets, different timelines, same tools

**Recommended Resolution:**

```
Decision: Coordinated testing strategy with shared utilities

Unified Approach:
├─ Week 7-8: Build mcp-common testing utilities (Phase 4)
│   ├─ MockMCPClient
│   ├─ Mock adapters (HTTP, rate limiter, security)
│   ├─ DI override patterns
│   └─ Fixture library
│
├─ Week 9-10: session-mgmt initial testing (Phase 5)
│   ├─ Use mcp-common testing utilities
│   ├─ Target: 35% → 45% (while adopting mcp-common)
│   └─ Focus: Core adapter usage tests
│
├─ Week 11-13: Parallel testing improvements
│   ├─ Other servers: 59% → 70% average (using mcp-common utils)
│   └─ session-mgmt: 45% → 60% (template tests)
│
└─ Week 17-19: session-mgmt excellence sprint
    ├─ Target: 60% → 85%+ (final push)
    ├─ Property-based tests with Hypothesis
    ├─ Chaos engineering tests
    └─ Integration test expansion

Benefits:
1. Shared testing utilities (no duplication)
2. Gradual coverage improvement (not all at once)
3. session-mgmt proves utility patterns
4. Other servers benefit from session-mgmt learnings
```

**Testing Utility Sharing:**
```python
# mcp_common/testing.py - Built in Phase 4 (Week 8-9)
class MockMCPClient:
    """Mock MCP client for testing."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.called_tools = []

    async def call_tool(self, name: str, **kwargs):
        self.called_tools.append((name, kwargs))
        return {"success": True}

class MockHTTPClientAdapter:
    """Mock HTTP adapter for DI override."""
    def __init__(self, responses: dict):
        self.responses = responses
        self.called = False

    async def _create_client(self):
        self.called = True
        return self._mock_client

# Usage in session-mgmt tests (Week 10+):
from mcp_common.testing import MockMCPClient, MockHTTPClientAdapter

async def test_session_start():
    # Override HTTP adapter in DI
    mock_http = MockHTTPClientAdapter(
        responses={"https://api.example.com": {"ok": True}}
    )
    depends.override(HTTPClientAdapter, mock_http)

    # Test uses mock automatically
    result = await session_start()
    assert result["success"]
    assert mock_http.called
```

### Overlap 6: Template-Based Formatting 🟡 MEDIUM

**mcp-common Plan:**
```
Not explicitly mentioned in phases, but implied in:
- Phase 6: Integrated Server Enhancement
- Pattern: ACB-enabled UI/console improvements
```

**session-mgmt Plan:**
```
Phase 3.1 (Week 7-8): Template-Based Formatting
├─ Replace 128 string-formatting helpers
├─ Use Jinja2 templates orchestrated by ACB
├─ Expected: -2,500 lines
└─ Deliverable: Template bundle with versioned naming
```

**Conflict Analysis:**

| Aspect | mcp-common | session-mgmt | Risk |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Timeline | Not scheduled | Week 7-8 (Phase 3.1) | session-mgmt builds alone |
| Patterns | Would design later | Implements now | Divergence risk |
| Reusability | Multi-server focus | Single-server focus | Different priorities |
| Integration | ACB console | Rich + Jinja2 | May differ |

**Opportunity for Coordination:**

**Recommended Resolution:**

```
Decision: Build templates in mcp-common during Phase 4, session-mgmt adopts

Coordinated Approach:
├─ Week 8-9 (Phase 4): mcp-common template foundation
│   ├─ Jinja2 integration with ACB
│   ├─ Template loader via DI
│   ├─ Base templates for common patterns:
│   │   ├─ Status displays
│   │   ├─ Quality reports
│   │   ├─ Tool results
│   │   └─ Error messages
│   └─ TemplateRenderer service
│
├─ Week 10-11 (Phase 5): session-mgmt begins migration
│   ├─ Adopt mcp-common TemplateRenderer
│   ├─ Migrate 50 of 128 functions (high-frequency)
│   └─ Create session-mgmt-specific templates
│
└─ Week 12-13 (Phase 6): Complete migration
    ├─ Migrate remaining 78 functions
    ├─ Refine templates based on usage
    └─ Contribute reusable templates to mcp-common

Benefits:
1. Templates designed for reuse from start
2. Other servers benefit immediately
3. session-mgmt doesn't build isolated solution
4. Unified template conventions across ecosystem
5. mcp-common templates proven in session-mgmt
```

**Template Structure:**
```
mcp-common/
├── templates/
│   ├── base/
│   │   ├── status.jinja2        # Generic status display
│   │   ├── quality_report.jinja2
│   │   ├── tool_result.jinja2
│   │   └── error.jinja2
│   ├── sessions/                # session-mgmt specific
│   │   ├── checkpoint.jinja2
│   │   ├── session_summary.jinja2
│   │   └── quality_delta.jinja2
│   └── shared/                  # Multi-server templates

│   ├── advanced_quality.jinja2
│   ├── reflection_results.jinja2
│   └── crackerjack_report.jinja2
```

**Migration Strategy:**
```python
# Before: String formatting (128 functions, 2,500 lines)
def format_quality_report(score, metrics, recommendations):
    output = f"Quality Score: {score}/100\n"
    output += f"Metrics:\n"
    for key, value in metrics.items():
        output += f"  {key}: {value}\n"
    # ... 50 more lines
    return output

# After: Template rendering (via mcp-common)
from mcp_common.ui import TemplateRenderer

@depends.inject
def format_quality_report(
    score, metrics, recommendations,
    renderer: TemplateRenderer = depends.inject()
):
    return renderer.render("quality_report.jinja2", {
        "score": score,
        "metrics": metrics,
        "recommendations": recommendations
    })

# Result: 128 functions → 30 template calls = -2,500 lines
```

---

## Consolidation Recommendations

### Unified Timeline (13 Weeks vs 26 Weeks)

**Original Sequential Approach:**
```
mcp-common: 10 weeks
session-mgmt: 16 weeks (after mcp-common)
Total: 26 weeks sequential
```

**Unified Parallel Approach:**
```
Week 1-7: Complete active work (both streams)
Week 8-9: Build mcp-common core library
Week 10-13: Parallel adoption (session-mgmt + other servers)
Week 14-16: Deep integration (query + events)
Week 17-19: Excellence sprint
Total: 13 weeks parallel
Savings: 13 weeks (50% reduction)
```

### Work Elimination Through Coordination

| Work Item | Without Coordination | With Coordination | Savings |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Config Migration | 40h (2 migrations) | 24h (1 migration) | 16 hours |
| DI Implementation | 60h (build + migrate) | 40h (learn + adopt) | 20 hours |
| HTTP Adapters | 24h (custom + migrate) | 12h (adopt) | 12 hours |
| Template System | 48h (isolated + align) | 32h (coordinated) | 16 hours |
| Testing Utilities | 40h (duplicate) | 24h (shared) | 16 hours |
| **TOTAL SAVINGS** | **212 hours** | **132 hours** | **80 hours** |

**80 hours saved = 2 weeks of development time**

### Resource Optimization

**Original Resource Profile:**
```
mcp-common: 1.4 FTE avg × 10 weeks = 14 FTE-weeks
session-mgmt: 1.4 FTE avg × 16 weeks = 22.4 FTE-weeks
Total: 36.4 FTE-weeks (sequential)
```

**Unified Resource Profile:**
```
Phase 3-4: 2.0 FTE × 3 weeks = 6 FTE-weeks
Phase 5-6: 1.5 FTE × 4 weeks = 6 FTE-weeks
Phase 7: 2.0 FTE × 3 weeks = 6 FTE-weeks
Phase 8: 1.5 FTE × 3 weeks = 4.5 FTE-weeks
Total: 22.5 FTE-weeks (parallel)
Savings: 13.9 FTE-weeks (38% reduction)
```

### Risk Reduction Through Coordination

**Risks Eliminated:**
1. ✅ Double migration eliminated (config, cache, DI)
2. ✅ Pattern divergence prevented (templates, testing)
3. ✅ Adoption friction reduced (session-mgmt proves patterns)
4. ✅ Timeline compression (parallel execution)
5. ✅ Resource optimization (shared development)

**Risks Accepted:**
1. ⚠️ Phase 2.7 migration cost (40 hours, acceptable)
2. ⚠️ Template coordination complexity (managed via clear specs)
3. ⚠️ Tight coupling between workstreams (requires coordination)

## Quality Impact Analysis

### session-mgmt-mcp Quality Trajectory

**Without Coordination (Original Plan):**
```
Week 0: Quality 68/100, ACB 0/10
Week 2: Quality 72/100, ACB 3/10 (direct ACB)
Week 6: Quality 80/100, ACB 6/10 (direct ACB + DI)
Week 8: Quality 80/100, ACB 6/10 (migrate to mcp-common starts)
Week 12: Quality 88/100, ACB 9/10 (mcp-common adopted)
Week 16: Quality 95/100, ACB 9/10 (excellence complete)
```

**With Unified Coordination:**
```
Week 0: Quality 68/100, ACB 0/10
Week 7: Quality 71/100, ACB 0/10 (Phase 2 complete, Phase 2.7 in progress)
Week 9: Quality 71/100, ACB 0/10 (mcp-common ready)
Week 11: Quality 75/100, ACB 6/10 (mcp-common adopted)
Week 13: Quality 80/100, ACB 6/10 (templates complete)
Week 16: Quality 85/100, ACB 9/10 (query + events)
Week 19: Quality 95/100, ACB 9/10 (excellence complete)
```

**Analysis:**
- Delayed ACB integration initially (building foundation right)
- Steeper quality improvement curve (Week 11-19)
- Same final outcome (95/100) with better architecture
- Lower risk of rework (single migration path)

### Ecosystem Health Impact

**Multi-Server Benefits:**
```
Current State (Pre-Unified Plan):
├─ 6 standalone servers: Avg 74/100
├─ 3 integrated servers: Not using shared patterns
└─ session-mgmt: 71/100

After Phase 8 (Unified Plan):
├─ 6 standalone servers: Avg 86/100 (+12)
├─ 3 integrated servers: 88/100 (shared patterns)
├─ session-mgmt: 95/100 (+24)
└─ Ecosystem average: 89/100 (excellent)

Key Improvements:
1. Unified config across all 9 servers
2. Consistent HTTP client patterns
3. Standardized rate limiting
4. Shared testing utilities
5. Common template system
6. Aligned DI patterns
```

## Critical Path Analysis

### Sequential Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Phase 3: Complete Active Work] --> B[Phase 4: mcp-common Core]
    B --> C[Phase 5: session-mgmt Adoption]
    C --> D[Phase 7: Query + Events]
    D --> E[Phase 8: Excellence]

    B -.-> F[Phase 6: Other Servers]
    F -.-> E

    C -.-> G[Phase 6: Templates]
    G --> D
```

**Critical Path (8.5 weeks):**
1. Phase 3: 1 week (stabilize)
2. Phase 4: 2 weeks (build library)
3. Phase 5: 2 weeks (first adopter)
4. Phase 7: 3 weeks (query + events)
5. Phase 8: 0.5 weeks (session-mgmt final polish)

**Parallel Paths (4.5 weeks):**
1. Phase 6: Server migrations (2 weeks, parallel with Phase 5-7)
2. Phase 8: Testing and documentation (2.5 weeks, parallel with other work)

**Total Timeline:** 8.5 weeks critical + 4.5 weeks parallel = 13 weeks calendar time

### Bottleneck Analysis

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

1. **Phase 4 Library Development (Week 8-9)**
   - Risk: Quality issues cascade to all servers
   - Mitigation: 90%+ test coverage requirement, comprehensive review
   - Contingency: Extend Phase 4 by 1 week if needed

2. **Phase 5 session-mgmt Adoption (Week 10-11)**
   - Risk: Migration issues block other servers
   - Mitigation: Detailed migration checklist, rollback procedures
   - Contingency: Keep other servers on schedule, session-mgmt extends if needed

3. **Phase 7 Query + Events (Week 14-16)**
   - Risk: Complex changes cause regressions
   - Mitigation: Feature flags, parallel systems, comprehensive testing
   - Contingency: Extend by 1 week, simplify EventBus scope

**Bottleneck Mitigation Strategy:**
- Weekly progress reviews to catch delays early
- Buffer week in Phase 8 for catching up
- Parallel work can absorb minor delays
- Clear rollback procedures at each phase

## Conclusion & Recommendations

### Summary of Findings

**Completed Work (29.4%):**
- ✅ mcp-common: Phases 1-3 documentation and critical fixes
- ✅ session-mgmt: Phase 1-2 complete (server decomposition)
- ✅ session-mgmt: Phase 2.7 80% complete (DI wiring)
- ✅ Bonus work: Health checks, shutdown, comprehensive docs

**Critical Conflicts Resolved:**
1. ✅ ACB integration: Single path through mcp-common
2. ✅ Config migration: One-step adoption of MCPBaseSettings
3. ✅ DI patterns: Accept Phase 2.7, migrate in Phase 5
4. ✅ Templates: Coordinated development in mcp-common
5. ✅ Testing: Shared utilities, coordinated coverage improvements

**Timeline Optimization:**
- Original: 26 weeks sequential
- Unified: 13 weeks parallel
- Savings: 50% reduction (13 weeks)

**Resource Optimization:**
- Original: 36.4 FTE-weeks
- Unified: 22.5 FTE-weeks
- Savings: 38% reduction (13.9 FTE-weeks)

### Primary Recommendations

**1. Adopt Unified Roadmap (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Replace both individual plans with unified 13-week plan
- Immediate benefit: Clear path forward, no conflicts
- Timeline: Start Week 8 (after Phase 3 completion)

**2. Complete Phase 2.7 as Planned (URGENT)**
- Finish session-mgmt DI wiring this week
- Document patterns for mcp-common learning
- Accept 40-hour migration cost in Phase 5
- Rationale: 80% complete, blocking costs more than migrating

**3. Build mcp-common Quality Foundation (CRITICAL)**
- Week 8-9: Focus on 90%+ test coverage for library
- Use session-mgmt patterns as reference
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Rationale: Quality issues cascade to all 9 servers

**4. Coordinate Template Development (IMPORTANT)**
- Build templates in mcp-common Phase 4
- session-mgmt adopts and refines in Phase 5-6
- Share reusable patterns across ecosystem
- Rationale: Avoid isolated template system

**5. Maintain Weekly Coordination (ONGOING)**
- Progress reviews every Monday
- Risk assessment and mitigation updates
- Stakeholder communication
- Rationale: Tight coordination required for success
