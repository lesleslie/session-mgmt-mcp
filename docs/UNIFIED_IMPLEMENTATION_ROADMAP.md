## Critical Overlap & Conflict Analysis

### Overlap 1: ACB Integration Foundation

**mcp-common Plan:** Phase 1 creates ACB-native library foundation
**session-mgmt Plan:** Phase 1 installs ACB for direct adoption

**Conflict:** Both plans install/use ACB independently without coordination

**Resolution:**
```
Unified Phase 4: mcp-common ACB Library Implementation
‚îú‚îÄ Week 7: Build mcp-common core with ACB patterns
‚îú‚îÄ Week 8: Test mcp-common in isolation
‚îî‚îÄ Week 9+: session-mgmt-mcp adopts mcp-common (not raw ACB)

Result: Single ACB integration point through mcp-common library
```

### Overlap 2: Configuration Management

**mcp-common Plan:** MCPBaseSettings class (Phase 1, extends acb.config.Settings)
**session-mgmt Plan:** Replace custom config.py with ACB config (Phase 1)

**Conflict:** session-mgmt would build direct ACB config, then migrate again to mcp-common

**Resolution:**
```
Unified Approach:
1. Build MCPBaseSettings in mcp-common first (unified Phase 4)
2. session-mgmt-mcp adopts mcp-common config in Phase 3.2
3. No double migration - single step to final pattern

Savings: ~2 weeks of redundant config work
```

### Overlap 3: HTTP Client & Rate Limiting

**mcp-common Plan:** HTTPClientAdapter + RateLimiterAdapter (Phase 1-2)
**session-mgmt Plan:** Not explicitly mentioned (assumed direct ACB)

**Conflict:** session-mgmt might implement custom patterns before mcp-common ready

**Resolution:**
```
Unified Approach:
1. mcp-common implements adapters in Phase 4 (Week 7-8)
2. session-mgmt continues with existing HTTP until mcp-common ready
3. Adopt mcp-common adapters in Phase 3 (template/query phase)

Benefit: No throwaway session-mgmt HTTP implementation
```

### Overlap 4: Dependency Injection

**mcp-common Plan:** DI configuration module (Phase 1, unified with ACB)
**session-mgmt Plan:** Phase 2.7 (in progress) - direct ACB DI wiring

**Conflict:** **ACTIVE CONFLICT** - Phase 2.7 is wiring DI directly without mcp-common patterns

**Resolution:**
```
URGENT: Phase 2.7 Completion Strategy
1. ‚úÖ Complete current DI wiring for session-mgmt (uses acb.depends directly)
2. ‚úÖ Document current DI patterns for migration reference
3. In unified Phase 5 (Week 9-10): Migrate session-mgmt to mcp-common DI patterns
4. Accept temporary direct ACB usage in session-mgmt (2-3 weeks)

Trade-off: Small amount of rework (~40 hours) vs. waiting 4-6 weeks for mcp-common
Decision: Continue Phase 2.7 ‚Üí migrate later (less risky than blocking)
```

### Overlap 5: Test Coverage Improvement

**mcp-common Plan:** Phase 4 (Week 3-5) - bring all servers to 70%
**session-mgmt Plan:** Phase 4 (Week 13-16) - sprint to 85%

**Conflict:** Different timelines, different targets for same codebase

**Resolution:**
```
Unified Testing Roadmap:
‚îú‚îÄ Week 7-8: mcp-common testing utilities built
‚îú‚îÄ Week 9-10: session-mgmt core tests (target 55%) using mcp-common
‚îú‚îÄ Week 11-12: Parallel - other servers to 70%, session-mgmt to 65%
‚îî‚îÄ Week 13-16: All servers including session-mgmt to 70%+, session-mgmt to 85%

Result: Coordinated testing with shared utilities
```

### Overlap 6: Template-Based Formatting

**mcp-common Plan:** Not explicitly mentioned (implied in adapter architecture)
**session-mgmt Plan:** Phase 3.1 (Week 7-8) - Replace 128 formatting helpers

**Conflict:** session-mgmt templates might not align with mcp-common patterns

**Resolution:**
```
Coordinated Template Strategy:
1. Week 7-8: Build mcp-common template patterns during library development
2. session-mgmt Phase 3.1 uses mcp-common template system (not custom)
3. Template patterns tested in session-mgmt, refined, shared with other servers

Benefit: Templates designed for multi-server use from start
```

**Risk:** Breaking production functionality during migration
**Mitigation:** Parallel validation, feature flags, comprehensive testing
**Owner:** session-mgmt-mcp maintainer

### 4. Test Coverage Ratchet
**Risk:** Coverage declining during refactoring
**Mitigation:** Coverage requirement in CI, increment-only policy
**Owner:** CI/CD pipeline + code review

### 5. Documentation Currency
**Risk:** Docs lagging implementation, adoption barriers
**Mitigation:** Doc updates required for PR approval, examples mandatory
**Owner:** Each phase owner

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

**Risk 1: mcp-common Adoption Friction (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)**
- **Symptom:** Servers resist migrating, prefer custom implementations
- **Mitigation:**
  - Session-mgmt as reference implementation (prove value)
  - Migration guide with before/after metrics
  - Gradual adoption path with fallbacks
  - Developer support during migration
- **Contingency:** Keep custom implementations for 4 weeks post-migration

**Risk 2: Phase 2.7 DI Wiring Conflicts (Likelihood: High, Impact: Medium)**
- **Symptom:** Current DI patterns incompatible with mcp-common patterns
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document current patterns thoroughly
  - Accept 40-hour rework budget in Phase 5
  - Learn from session-mgmt DI to improve mcp-common
- **Contingency:** mcp-common DI adapter layer for session-mgmt patterns

**Risk 3: Template Migration Complexity (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium)**
- **Symptom:** Template output differs from string formatting, visual regressions
- **Mitigation:**
  - Snapshot testing (golden transcripts)
  - Gradual migration (5 functions/day)
  - Visual diff review for all changes
- **Contingency:** Keep formatting functions for 3 weeks, toggle flag

**Risk 4: Query Interface Performance (Likelihood: Low, Impact: High)**
- **Symptom:** ACB query slower than custom SQL
- **Mitigation:**
  - Performance benchmarking before/after
  - Connection pooling and optimization
  - Query plan analysis
- **Contingency:** Custom query fallback for critical paths

### Medium-Risk Items

**Risk 5: Test Coverage Sprint Burnout (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Low)**
- **Mitigation:** Distribute testing across phases, use property-based testing
- **Contingency:** Extend Phase 8 by 1 week if needed

**Risk 6: Multi-Server Migration Coordination (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium)**
- **Mitigation:** Clear migration order, dedicated migration windows
- **Contingency:** Stagger migrations over 2 additional weeks

### Mitigation Strategy

**General Principles:**
1. **Feature Flags:** All major changes behind toggles
2. **Parallel Running:** Old + new systems during transition
3. **Incremental Migration:** Never big-bang changes
4. **Comprehensive Testing:** 70%+ for new code before merge
5. **Monitoring:** Metrics for all critical paths

**Emergency Rollback Plan:**
- Git tags: `mcp-common-v2.0.0`, `phase-5-complete`, etc.
- Toggle flags: `USE_MCP_COMMON_CONFIG`, `USE_MCP_COMMON_DI`, etc.
- Original code retained 4 weeks post-migration
- Automated rollback scripts: `scripts/rollback_phase_N.sh`
