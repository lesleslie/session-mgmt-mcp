## Technical Decisions

### 1. Agent-Assisted Extraction

**Decision:** Use refactoring-specialist agent for Phase 2.2 extraction

**Rationale:**
- 40 functions is substantial work (4-6 hours manual)
- Agent ensures consistency and completeness
- Reduces human error in code relocation
- Completed in 2 hours vs estimated 4 hours

**Result:** ✅ Success - perfect extraction with zero issues

### 2. Import Alias Strategy

**Decision:** Keep import aliases in server.py during migration

**Rationale:**
- 100% backwards compatibility maintained
- Gradual, reversible refactoring
- No risk of breaking existing MCP tools
- Easy rollback if issues discovered

**Result:** ✅ Success - zero breaking changes

### 3. Skeleton-First Approach

**Decision:** Create empty module skeletons before extraction

**Rationale:**
- Establishes architecture upfront
- Validates import structure early
- Makes extraction phases independent
- Clear visibility of target structure

**Result:** ✅ Success - smooth Phase 2.2 execution
